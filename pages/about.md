## About the Johnny Shanahan Collection

This site is generated as a test of Github's capabilities. I used sample data from CollectionBuilder to make this page, including: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
